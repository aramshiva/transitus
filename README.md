# Transitus
Transitus is a work in progress open-source set of experiements using Sound Transit (Seattle's transit agency)'s live data. The first experiment/site is the map, showing every vehicle active and information about it! Try it out by looking around the map and clicking vehicles, and everything is dynamic and live real data!

The app is written in Next.js and Tailwind CSS. A Sound Transit Open Transit Data OneBusAway API key is **required** to run in development.
