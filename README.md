# Transitus
Transitus is a work in progress open-source set of experiements using Sound Transit (Seattle's transit agency)'s live data. The first experiment/site is the map, showing every vehicle active and information about it! Try it out by looking around the map and clicking vehicles, and everything is dynamic and live real data!
